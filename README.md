## Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes essential elements such as a logo, delivery information, a search bar, user account options, and a cart icon.
- **Hero Section**: Features a welcoming message and a call-to-action link directing users to the Indian version of Amazon.
- **Product Display Sections**: Multiple product display boxes representing different departments, each with a heading and a "See More" link.
- **Footer**: Contains links to important informational pages, enhancing usability and providing easy access to additional information.
